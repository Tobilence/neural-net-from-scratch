# Neural Network in Python

This was one of my first beginner projects I used to get into the AI space. It contains a functional neural net written without any deep learning libraries. I used it to deepen my understanding of mathemathics behind deep learning.

The following components have been implemented:
 - Dense & Dropout Layers
 - Activation Functions (Sigmoid, ReLU)
 - Loss Functions (MSE, MAE, Categorical- & Binary Crossentropy)
 - Optimizers (Adam, SGD)
 - Model object (encapsulating the process of training & testing)

To demonstrate & verify the neural network, I included a script that learns to classify Zalando images. More info's about this problem & dataset are accessible [here](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist).
